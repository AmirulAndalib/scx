# scx_edfgpt

This is a single user-defined scheduler used within [sched_ext](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx/tree/main), which is a Linux kernel feature which enables implementing kernel thread schedulers in BPF and dynamically loading them.

## Overview

`scx_edfgpt` is a simple earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduler, based on the
`scx_rustland_core` framework, automatically generated by ChatGPT.

The code was generated by providing the `README.md` of `scx_rustland_core` as
input and requesting to use such framework to generate an EDF scheduler.

Abstracted guidance on how to evaluate task deadline and time slice was also
provided.

This scheduler is provided as a template to show the potential of
`scx_rustland_core` and it is not meant to be used in real production
environments.

## Typical Use Case

The goal of this scheduler is to demonstrate the ease of use of the
`scx_rustland_core` framework.

## Production Ready?

Definitely not.
